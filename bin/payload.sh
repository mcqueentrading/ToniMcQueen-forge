# keeps FlashForge's stock klippy, unread -- the only file still read there is
# klipper_pri.sh, their SCHED_FIFO helper. klipperDaemon at that path is a
# symlink to our shim, pointed there by anvil-link-prog.sh.
#
# A gate here would ask whether apk had installed the package it was just
# handed, of a staging root three lines after it was filled.
# qa/replica/test_install.py::test_klippy_is_present asks it of an installed
# filesystem instead, which is the vehicle that reaches a printer.

# --- 4. the s6-rc database
# Compiled in the replica by case-build-payload.sh, with the s6-rc-compile
# anvil-s6-rc ships, straight after apk installs the feed. Compiling with the
# compiler we SHIP is what makes the #! baked into the oneshot runner point at
# the execline we ship rather than the build host's -- a native second build of
# the same tarballs had to be held to --prefix=$MODDIR by hand to get that
# right. (Byte-identical either way: 80-s6-migration.md, measured 2026-08-28.)
#
# Nothing to assert here either. qa/replica/test_s6rc.py boots the database on
# a machine: s6-rc-init reads it, the boot set comes up, and a database moved
# aside is reported.
