# How calibration works

This machine has several calibrations, and they are not the same kind of
thing: some you run once and forget, one runs itself on every print, and one
imported itself the first time the mod booted. This page is what each of them
actually measures. The procedures are elsewhere and are linked from each
section.

| Calibration | Run it | Procedure |
|---|---|---|
| **XYZ tool offsets** | after flashing, and whenever a tool or the station is disturbed | [XYZ tool calibration](calibration.md) |
| **Bed mesh** | automatically, at every print start | [Bed mesh](bed-mesh.md) |
| **Input shaping** | once, and after mechanical changes | — |
| **VFA compensation** | rarely — it is a property of the motors, and it ships calibrated | — |
| **Pressure advance** | manually — from HelixScreen's calibration screen or the console, per tool | [Pressure advance](pressure-advance.md) |

## XYZ tool offsets

Where each nozzle is, relative to a fixed feature under the bed. This is the
one that stops a nozzle being driven into the plate, and the one the print
gate refuses to start without.


### What is being measured

The calibration station is a fixed bore **under the bed plane**, near the back
left. Two different things can reach into it:

| Reaching body | When | Trigger height |
|---|---|---|
| the **bare carriage** | nothing mounted | `station_z` |
| a tool's **nozzle** | that tool mounted | `nozzle_z` for that tool |

The carriage's own probe element sits *above* where a tool mounts, so it can
only reach the station when the carriage is empty. That is the whole reason
the order below is what it is: **the reference is measured first, with no
tool**, and every tool is then measured against it.

This is why upstream's "run `TOOL_LOCATE_SENSOR` with tool 0" becomes "run it
with *no* tool" here — and why our baseline cannot be spoiled by a badly
seated T0. Each tool's numbers are absolute and independent: recalibrating T2
leaves T0, T1 and T3 valid.

---

### From a measurement to a print

The measurements above are just numbers about a hole under the bed. Three
things turn them into a first layer.

**A reference the tools are compared against.** Probing the station with the
bare carriage fixes where the station is in the machine's own coordinates.
Everything else is expressed against that, which is why the reference is
measured first and why a badly seated tool cannot spoil it.

**One absolute number per tool.** Probing the station again with a tool
mounted gives that nozzle's own position. The difference between the two —
nozzle against reference — is the gap between where Z homing thinks zero is
and where that particular nozzle actually is. It comes out around 3.2 mm,
and it is different for every tool.

Because each tool is measured against the same fixed reference rather than
against another tool, the numbers are independent. Recalibrating one leaves
the others exactly as they were.

**A coordinate shift on every toolchange.** This is the part that differs
from the stock firmware. When a tool is grabbed, the toolchanger shifts the
coordinate system by that tool's own numbers: the Z gap, plus any per-tool
trim, plus the XY difference between this tool and the base tool. From that
moment Z0 is the plate for *this* nozzle, and the file's coordinates need no
adjustment at all.

The stock application did this once per print, as a single absolute offset
computed at print start. Doing it per grab is what lets a file that changes
tools mid-print stay correct after every change.

At print start a few smaller terms are added on top — the thermal expansion
of a hot nozzle, the bed at temperature, and a correction for very thin first
layers. They are small, a few hundredths of a millimetre, but they are the
difference between a first layer that sticks and one that does not.

### What each command does

#### `TOOL_LOCATE_SENSOR` — the reference

`[SAVE=1]`

1. Homes if any axis is unhomed, parks the mounted tool, and verifies
   the carriage really is empty, from the dock and grab sensors.
2. Plate check: probes station Z with the bare carriage, then sideways for
   the bore edge.
3. Moves to the station start point (`cylinder_x`, `cylinder_y`, 28.5 /
   214.5 stock) and probes Z.
4. **Pass 1** — four sideways probes outward at Z + 0.6 (+X, +Y, −X, −Y,
   14 mm each), least-squares circle fit.
5. **Pass 2** — the same four probes re-centred on that fit, with Z
   re-probed there.
6. Stages `station_x`, `station_y`, `station_z` into `[ff_tool_offset]`.

#### `TOOL_CALIBRATE_TOOL_OFFSET` — one tool

No arguments, exactly as upstream. It measures **whatever is on the
carriage** — select the tool first.

`[SAVE=1]`

1. Homes if any axis is unhomed, then the plate check. Both need an empty
   carriage, so your tool is parked and picked straight back up — that is
   expected, not a fault.
2. Zeroes the G-code offset and works in raw machine coordinates.
3. Same two passes as above, from `cylinder_x − 12.5` (16.0 stock), with the
   nozzle doing the touching.
4. Checks `nozzle_z − station_z` lands in `gap_min`…`gap_max` (1.5–5.0 mm;
   ~3.2 mm is right on a healthy machine).
5. Stages `nozzle_x`, `nozzle_y`, `nozzle_z` into `[ff_tool <n>]`.
6. Heater off for that tool, lifts to Z15, restores the offset frame.

#### `SAVE_CONFIG`

Writes the staged values into `printer.cfg`'s `#*#` block and restarts
Klipper. **Nothing persists until you run it.** `SAVE=0` on either command
measures and reports without staging anything.

### Where the numbers live

Autosaved into `printer.cfg`'s `SAVE_CONFIG` block. Never write these in an
included file — `SAVE_CONFIG` refuses to autosave an option an include
already sets.

```
#*# [ff_tool_offset]
#*# station_x = 28.791826
#*# station_y = 212.639328
#*# station_z = -1.678819
#*#
#*# [ff_tool 0]
#*# nozzle_x = 16.505066
#*# nozzle_y = 212.775040
#*# nozzle_z = 1.472569
#*# z_adjust = -0.020
```

On every grab of a tool, the toolchanger applies:

```
X = nozzle_x[tool] - nozzle_x[base]              difference vs the base tool
Y = nozzle_y[tool] - nozzle_y[base]
Z = nozzle_z[tool] - station_z + z_adjust[tool]  absolute
```

X and Y are differences, so the base tool's are zero. Z is absolute, which is
what makes Z0 the bed plane whenever a tool is mounted — not only after
`TOOLCHANGE_SET_PRINT_OFFSET` at print start.

Those go into a move transform **below** Klipper's own G-code offset, so
these stack without ever sharing a number:

| Layer | Set by | Scope | Read it as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SET_GCODE_OFFSET` / `homing_origin` | you, and nothing else | every tool | `printer.gcode_move.homing_origin.z` |
| transform, job Z | `TOOLCHANGE_SET_PRINT_OFFSET`'s thermal/bed/layer terms | this print | `printer.toolchanger.print_z_offset` |
| transform, XYZ | `TOOL_CALIBRATE_TOOL_OFFSET` | the mounted tool | `printer["tool T<n>"].gcode_z_offset` |

Selecting a tool swaps the lower two and moves nothing. Ending a print calls
`TOOLCHANGE_SET_PRINT_OFFSET CLEAR=1`, which drops the job term and leaves
both the calibration and your babystep alone — so the number a UI shows as
"Z offset" or "baby stepping" really is just yours.

The flip side: `printer.gcode_move.position` is no longer the machine
position, because it is read *above* the transform. `gcode_position` and
`M114` are unchanged. A macro that wants the true machine Z of a G-code Z
has to subtract all three columns above.

See [`toolchange.md`](toolchange.md) for the toolchanger as a whole, and
[`notes/45-tool-offset-calibration.md`](notes/45-tool-offset-calibration.md)
for how the sequence was recovered from the stock firmware.

## Bed mesh

The shape of the plate, measured by probing a grid of points across it, so
the first layer can follow a bed that is not perfectly flat. 10×10 points,
bicubic interpolation, probed with the eddy sensor on the carriage — the same
sensor `G28 Z` homes on, which is why it can measure the plate but sits about
3.2 mm below the nozzle tip and cannot measure a nozzle.

**A mesh is always active for a print.** That was true of the stock firmware
too, and the mechanism is the same one, because it was always Klipper doing
the probing — the application only decided when.

There are two named profiles, and knowing which is which explains most
surprises:

| Profile | What it is |
|---|---|
| `MESH_DATA` | the factory mesh, probed before the printer shipped. Older startup paths loaded this unless told otherwise |
| `default` | the working profile `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` writes into |

On the local full-colour branch, `START_PRINT` does not blindly load
`MESH_DATA`. Given `LEVEL=1` it probes a fresh mesh — dropping acceleration to
2000 for the probing run and putting it back afterwards — and loads `default`.
Given `MESH=<profile>`, it loads that named mesh. If neither is supplied, it
leaves the current active mesh alone.

That is intentional for modified machines and flipped build plates: probe or
load the mesh you trust, then do not let old startup code silently restore
`MESH_DATA`.

## Input shaping

How much the machine rings when it accelerates, so Klipper can shape moves to
avoid exciting that ringing. It is Klipper's own calibration
(`SHAPER_CALIBRATE`, `TEST_RESONANCES`, `MEASURE_AXES_NOISE`), and it works
the way it does on any Klipper printer.

One thing is specific to a toolchanger: the commands are wrapped so that they
home if needed and **grab a head first** when the carriage is empty. A bare
carriage weighs less than a loaded one, and resonance measured on the wrong
mass describes a machine you do not own. Which head it picks is configurable,
and it stays mounted afterwards.

The stock application did the same thing for the same reason.

## VFA compensation

VFA is *vertical fine artifacts* — the fine vertical banding a stepper's own
torque ripple prints onto a wall. **It is not input shaping**, and the
distinction matters because the touchscreen listed the two next to each other.
Input shaping changes how moves are planned. This changes the current going
into the motor: a small sinusoid added at one, two and four times the
electrical frequency, phased to cancel the ripple that the motor produces by
existing.

That correction is applied by the driver, not by Klipper. The main board runs a
closed-loop, current-controlled stepper driver — it is told winding resistance,
inductance, torque constant and current-loop gains, and it synthesises the
phase currents itself — so the compensation lives inside that loop and is
active on every move, whether or not anything is calibrating. Klipper's part is
only to hand it six numbers per motor and to remember them.

That is why this is the calibration you are least likely to need. The numbers
are a property of your specific motors, they are already calibrated when the
machine reaches you, and nothing about printing drifts them. Re-run it if you
replace a motor, or if you can see fine vertical banding that input shaping
does not touch.

### Running it

There is no wizard, and this one is console work:

```
STEPPER_RESONANCE_FACTORY_CALIBRATE
SAVE_CONFIG
```

It sweeps each motor at the speed that puts its electrical frequency on
resonance, reads the accelerometer, and searches amplitude and phase for each
harmonic — roughly nineteen short moves per harmonic per direction, so the
whole run takes a while and the machine is deliberately noisy during it.

**`SAVE_CONFIG` is not optional and is not part of the macro.** The search
applies each result immediately so it can measure the next one, and stages the
final numbers for saving — but only `SAVE_CONFIG` writes them. Without it the
calibration is lost at the next restart. It is left as a separate step because
`SAVE_CONFIG` restarts Klipper, which is not something a macro should do to you
mid-session. The stock application split it exactly the same way.

Like the input-shaper commands, the search grabs a head first if the carriage
is empty, for the same moving-mass reason.

The stock application ran this from its own calibration flow; the commands
underneath are FlashForge's, unchanged.

## Pressure advance

Pressure advance is the correction for the lag between the extruder motor
turning and plastic actually arriving at the tip: without it, a corner prints
either a blob (the pressure built up on the way in has to go somewhere) or a
gap (the pressure never built up to begin with). It is a property of the
whole drive train from motor to nozzle, so it is calibrated per tool — each
of the four nozzles gets its own number.

Measuring it needs a live signal, not a ruler. The sweep prints a series of
short lines at increasing candidate pressure-advance values, each with a
sudden speed change, and asks the eBoard — the closed FlashForge board that
also runs the toolchanger's other sensors — whether it saw a clean transition
or not. That verdict is not something we compute: it comes back from a
transducer wired to the eBoard's own MCU, running firmware we ship unchanged
and have not reverse-engineered past the wire format. What is ours is
everything on the host side — the candidate values, the line geometry, the
retry and averaging rule — recovered from the stock firmware binary and
reproduced exactly
([`notes/51-pa-calibration-recovered.md`](notes/51-pa-calibration-recovered.md)).
We get the same verdicts the touchscreen does because we ask the same
firmware the same question.

FlashForge's own firmware runs this automatically, per tool, during the
nozzle clean at the start of every print. This port deliberately does not: a
full run is several sweeps of short lines and costs minutes and about a gram
of filament, every print, and the app only gets away with it because it is
gated behind a flag most users never see. Here it is a command you run
yourself, the same way PID tuning and input shaping already are — not
something that happens to your print without asking.

### Running it

`FF_PA_CALIBRATE` reports a number; it does not save or apply anything —
nothing in `printer.cfg` changes and nothing carries over to the next
toolchange until you put it there yourself. `FF_PA_PROBE` draws a single
line at one candidate value, for checking the eBoard is discriminating
between candidates at all before trusting a full sweep. HelixScreen's
calibration screen (v0.99.115-creator5.5 and later) can start the same run
from the touchscreen — it now recognises `FF_PA_CALIBRATE` as a calibration
provider on this machine.

The commands, what they print, and what to do with the result are on
[Pressure advance](pressure-advance.md).
