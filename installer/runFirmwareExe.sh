# THE INSTALLER. Ours, not FlashForge's.
#
# app_startup.sh finds a package on the USB stick, decrypts it with
# /usr/prog/bin/unTar into /usr/data/update/ and runs THIS file:
#
#     /usr/data/update/runFirmwareExe.sh <MACHINE> <PID>
#
# That is the whole contract, and the exit code is the other half of it:
#
#     exit 0     app_startup.sh unmounts the stick, deletes /usr/data/update
#                and sleeps for ever -- the "flashed, now power-cycle me"
#                state, with end.img on the panel.
#     exit != 0  it unmounts, deletes, and goes on booting the printer.
#
# So a gate that refuses to install must exit non-zero: the printer then comes
# up on whatever it had before, which is the right answer to "this package is
# not for this machine".
#
# It does two jobs. FlashForge's four components (control, kernel, software,
# library) are installed when a package carries them -- a --full one does --
# and then the mod payload is installed on top. A slim package carries no
# component at all and install_component skips each in turn, which is what lets
# a release leave /usr/prog entirely alone.
#
# See docs/how-it-works.md for where this sits in the boot chain.
#
# This runs under the printer's busybox ash. qa/static/test_shell_syntax.py
# parses it with that in mind; keep it dialect-clean.

# board firmware that release pairs with differs from the one klippy is built
# to talk to, and the MCU never connects. The failure is at the bottom of the
# stack -- no Klipper, so no UI and no Mainsail -- and it looks exactly like a
# bad flash to the person holding the USB stick.
#
# So it is refused HERE, before anything is written, with the fix in the
# message: install FlashForge's own current firmware first, then this package.
# That path costs one more flash and leaves a working printer either way,
# which is the whole reason for the gate.

# for the version of FlashForge's software component -- install_component
# below wipes the previous one before renaming the new one into place. That is
# the version an owner sees on the screen, and no package of ours ever ships a

# ---- klipper + moonraker configs -------------------------------------------
# Every file here is one the mod ships (ff-*.cfg, printer.chamber.cfg,
# moonraker.conf); printer.cfg is the user's and is never shipped, so it is
# never a candidate.
#
# ONE DIRECTORY, AND IT IS NOT FLASHFORGE'S. $CONFIG_DIR is the mod's own,
# seeded once from /usr/data/config by anvil-link-prog.sh; klippy is started
# on the printer.cfg in it and moonraker runs with `-d /usr/data/anvil-data`,
# so its config directory is the same one. FlashForge's /usr/data/config is
# not written to at all: it is what a printer flashed back to stock boots
# from, and nothing of ours runs during a stock flash to undo what was left
# there.
#
# Two rules, because the two kinds of file differ in whether the user has
# somewhere else to put a change.
#
# ff-*.cfg are OURS and are overwritten every update, no questions asked.
# Klipper hands the user a better seam than editing them: parsing is
# RawConfigParser(strict=False), so same-named sections MERGE, the last value
# of an option wins, and a redefined [gcode_macro] replaces the original.
# Overriding from printer.cfg AFTER the include survives every flash, while an
# edit here is reverted by the next one. Each file says so in its header.
#
# printer.base.cfg is on the same footing and needs no rule here: it is
# anvil-klipper-config's, and anvil-link-prog.sh symlinks $MODDIR/config into
# $CONFIG_DIR, so an upgrade repoints the link rather than editing a file.
# printer.chamber.cfg goes the same way -- see the case below.
#
# moonraker.conf is ours on the same terms, and it has the same kind of seam:
# [include moonraker-custom.conf] is its LAST line, Moonraker applies options in
# the order it reads them, so a tuned trusted_clients or cors_domains block set
# there wins over anything above. Overwriting is also how the [webcam] block and
# the API lockdown reach a printer at all -- a copy kept back because someone
# edited it would never receive either again.
#
# The path is repeated here rather than read from anvil-link-prog.sh: this
# script also runs on a machine where the payload never extracted, and one
# constant in two files beats a source that has to exist.

# ---- the root password ------------------------------------------------------
# Two ways in, and both end at the same place: this script edits
# /usr/prog/etc/shadow on the machine. (/etc is a bind mount of /usr/prog/etc,
# so that IS the live file dropbear authenticates against.)
#
# BAKED. ROOT_PW_HASH at build time, put here by bin/pack.sh. Applied on every
# flash, which is what the old path did too -- the hash rode in the software
# component's shadow and the component's run.sh copied it over the live file
# every time. Someone who bakes a hash into their own build is saying which
# password their printers have.
#
# RANDOM. An empty ROOT_PW_HASH cannot ship a password at all: one file is
# flashed by many people, so a baked-in default would be the SAME password on
# every printer. Pick a random one here, on the machine, and write it onto the
# USB stick being flashed from. Every printer gets a different one and it is
# never guessable from anything printed on the case.
#
# ORDER MATTERS: the password goes onto the stick and is read back BEFORE the
# printer starts accepting it. A password that was set but never landed on the
# stick is a locked-out printer, so if the write fails we change nothing at all
# and say so.
#
# AN UPDATE MUST NOT REROLL IT, and the test for that is one comparison. Root
# has a real password on a stock printer -- FlashForge ship the hash below, the
# same one on every machine, they just never published what it unlocks -- so
# the question is not "does root have a hash" but "is it still THEIRS". If it
# is, nobody has set one, by us or by hand with `passwd`, and it is ours to
# set. If it is not, someone has, and it is not ours to touch.
#
# Taken from the shadow in the stock software component
# (software-1.9.7.tar.xz, Creator5Pro). If FlashForge ever change it, a printer
# on the new firmware reads as "password already set" and never gets one --
# bin/pack.sh compares this against the stock package it was built from and
# fails the build rather than let that ship silently.
