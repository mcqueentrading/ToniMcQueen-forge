# Everything that has to happen before HelixScreen, and the panel that says so.
#
# Run as two s6-rc oneshots, between klipper and the UI. Two jobs, only the
# second once-per-install:
#
#   EVERY BOOT   wait until the printer is genuinely up -- the toolhead boards
#                handed over from their bootloaders, then klipper and moonraker
#                ready -- naming on the panel whatever is being waited for.
#                Three of the four boards need a handshake before they answer
#                and the heater board routinely costs klippy a restart or two.
#   FIRST BOOT   carry this unit's factory calibration from firmwareExe's JSON
#                into Klipper, then stamp the install so it never runs again.
#
# ITS OWN PROGRAM rather than a klippy:ready hook, because klippy:ready fires
# with moonraker possibly not yet listening, and a boot-time migration is a
# property of the INSTALL -- it wants a stamp on disk, not a guess re-evaluated
# on every ready.
#
#   1. Hand the toolhead boards over from their bootloaders, by calling
#      ff_mcu_bringup.py directly -- a module here, not a subprocess.
#   2. Wait for klippy and moonraker to be ready. If a board never answered,
#      hand the boards over again and restart klippy, which is what reopening
#      the port achieves.
#   3. If the install is already stamped, stop -- the rest is the migration.
#   4. Otherwise FF_IMPORT_FIRMWARE_CONFIG, then SAVE_CONFIG (which restarts
#      klippy), wait for it to come back, and only then stamp.
#
# TWO s6-rc ONESHOTS, both this same program. `mcu-bringup` is step 1 alone
# (--only-bringup) and klipper depends on it, so the boards are handed over
# before klippy opens the ports even when s6 restarts klippy after a crash.
# `ff-startup` is steps 2-4 (--no-bringup --no-klipper) and depends on klipper
# and moonraker; the UI depends on it.
#
# THE DEPENDENCY IS NOT ENOUGH, which is why the waiting below stays: s6-rc
# counts a longrun up as soon as it is forked unless its servicedir carries a
# notification-fd, and klipper has none -- klippy's "ready" is a state on
# moonraker's API, which is what this polls for. moonraker and the camera do
# have one, so depending on moonraker really does mean the API is answering.
#
# WHY IT STILL RESTARTS KLIPPER: the retry that fixes a board which missed its
# window is "close the port, hand it over again, reopen", so the thing doing
# the bring-up has to be the thing that restarts klippy. Via `s6-svc -wr -t`,
# NOT `s6-rc`: this runs INSIDE an s6-rc transition, which holds an exclusive
# lock on the live directory, so an s6-rc underneath it would deadlock.
#
# Anything short of a verified success leaves NO stamp and the next boot tries
# again. "The stack was not ready in time" is a normal event to retry.
#
# The browser UI is deliberately not consulted: everything travels over
# moonraker's API, and which UI is installed is a packaging choice.
#
# All of this happens before HelixScreen starts, so the screen is black for as
# long as it takes. ffscreen.py paints a line of text and a progress bar onto
# /dev/fb0 so nobody reaches for the power switch mid-SAVE_CONFIG; it is
# decoration, and --no-screen turns it off.
