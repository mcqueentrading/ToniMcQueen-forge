# THIS RECIPE HAS BOTH A TARBALL AND A payload/, the shape every recipe that
# adds something of ours to somebody else's tree now has: the tarball is the
# source, and payload/ is the $MODDIR overlay laid out exactly as it lands.
# printer_database.d/flashforge_creator5.json is what makes HelixScreen detect
# this machine as a tool changer -- it is meaningless without the tree it
# configures, and should go with it if HelixScreen is removed.
#
# NO pkg_toolchain: upstream ships the binaries built. That is also why this
# recipe compiles nothing and still declares an architecture -- what is in the
# tarball is mipsel ELF, gated on the way into the package.
