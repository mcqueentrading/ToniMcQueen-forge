"""The packages we build, and the recipes and payload they come out of.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT UNDER TEST HERE. The .apk archives are built by `apk
mkpkg`, which is upstream's tool and upstream's problem -- these tests do not re-derive
the format, they check the things that are OURS and that upstream cannot know
about: that the layout we hand it puts every path under $MODDIR, that the
architecture string is one no public feed can satisfy, that a package is
reproducible, and that the payload is exactly the feed installed.

WHAT IS ASKED IS THE BUILT ARTIFACT, never the text of a script in this repo.
A gate that grepped bin/ or pkgs/lib.sh for a spelling went red on a rename
and stayed green through a real regression, so the several that did are gone
rather than rewritten -- the questions they asked are ones only a built
package or the replica can answer.

Every test builds its own package out of a synthetic tree -- three files and
two symlinks, no compiler, no firmware image -- so the lane stays fast and
cannot be skipped into looking green.

IT DOES NEED work/host/bin/apk, which `make packages` builds. That is a
change to what qa/static costs, and it is deliberate: the alternative was to
hand-roll the archive format in this repo so that the tests needed nothing,
which is the trade the packager exists to stop making. A missing apk FAILS
rather than skips, for the reason qa/conftest.py gives about shellcheck.

The format itself was verified against real apk-tools 3.0.7 -- our own
cross-built mipsel binary, under qemu, building, installing, verifying and
removing packages on the printer. docs/notes/85-packaging.md records that run.
